Parachute Deployment
	  Determine Height using GPS
	  Deploy parachute at 1,000 feet (?)
	  First part of software to run.
	  Starts once separated from rocket.
	  Function which takes readings from GPS until under certain elevation
	  Then, Send signal to hardware component to deploy parachute.
	  Finally, switch to next part of software to check when the satellite hits the ground.

Getting Unstuck from Obstacles
	Must determine when stuck.
	     Can be determined by obstacle sensor not detecting change in terrain.
	Then, run function to get unstuck from obstacles.
	Function will try different combinations of directions and speeds to spin the treads, periodically checking if the rover has become unstuck by using the obstacle avoidance sensors.
	Once unstuck, end function, and resume normal operation.

Finding and Touching the Finish Pole
	Needs to run once close to the finish pole.
	GPS is accurate to within a few meters, so once within that area, switch to this function.
	In function, use software to search for pole by rotating the satellite so the obstacle sensors can get a 360 view.
	Once the pole has been found, orient the rover towards the pole, and drive into it.
