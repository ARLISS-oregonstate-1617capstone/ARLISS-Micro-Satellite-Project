\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to provide a thorough and verbose description of our teams software which we will be developing for use in the ARLISS International Competition; the acronym ARLISS referring to ‘A Rocket Launch for International Student Satellites’. The document will explain the purpose and features of the system, as well as, objective of the system, and the constraints under which it must operate. This document is intended for any stakeholders in the project, i.e. clients, instructors, and engineering collaborators, as well as, for the software developers who will be creating the system.

\section{Document Conventions}
This document follows IEEE Format. Bold-faced text has been used to emphasize section and sub-section headings. Highlighting is to point out words in the glossary and italicized text is used to label and recognize diagrams. Requirements will be prioritized into two categories; High-level requirements will be denoted with a heading of ‘Obligatory Requirements’, while stretch-goals will be denoted with a heading of ‘Secondary Requirements’.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is to be read by the software development team, the extended team of engineers who will be collaborating on this project, course instructors, and the client for the project. The document will be publicly accessible as well, and may be read by anyone viewing our exhibit. The document can, and will, be read by our peers in software development, as well as, engineers of all disciplines. 

Overall Description – The general public, as well as, the media may find the overall description to be most pertinent, and to give an adequate and effective overview of the ARLISS Project.

System Features – Developers, as well as, the extended team of engineers who are collaborating on this project will require a comprehensive understanding of the system features in order to integrate their design, and, additionally, for testing purposes.

Nonfunctional/Functional Requirements – The computer scientists developing the software, and the electrical and mechanical engineers developing the hardware will need to utilize, and adhere to, the requirements.

\section{Project Scope}
Our team of computer scientists will be developing software to operate an autonomously navigated satellite to a specified set of coordinates during the international competition. Our team’s satellite will be ejected from a rocket at approximately 12,000’ AGL, and fall safely to the surface of Earth with the aid of a parachute. During the estimated 15 minute “hang time” that the rocket spends in the air, there will be barometric reading taken every 1000ft by the satellite. Once the satellite reaches the ground it must detach from the parachute and circumvent any potential restraint created by the canopy or suspension lines of the parachute. Once moving, the autonomous satellite must utilize its system of cameras and radar to detect obstacles so that it may navigate around them. GPS will be necessary for the satellite to find the coordinates.

The most imperative objective of the software is to safely guide the satellite to its intended destination. This is a requisite, but the secondary objective of taking barometric readings is an additional goal which our group is confident in completing.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
This is a new and entirely self contained product. The software is composed of multiple independent systems which will be used at different steps in the satellite's mission. For example, once the satellite has been deployed from the rocket, the parachute deployment system will be used. These systems will be deployed in a specific order, and the timing of the deployment will be based on various sensor readings determining if the time is right to deploy the next system. The only user interface would be the graphing software used to display barometric readings obtained by the satellite during it's descent. The software would interface with many hardware components, including cameras, thermometers, servos, and various sensors. These components will serve as the software's eyes and ears. Memory and power will be constrained, so the software must be as memory and power efficient as possible.

\section{Product Functions}
The software has four main functions, which it performs at each stage of the mission. Each function is described in greater detail in section 3. Parachute deployment, change to drive mode, sensor and motor array initialization, and obstacle avoidance. 

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
The software as a whole is only useful in completing the specific challenges our specific satellite has to complete, although the individual parts of the software may be useful for other applications. Autonomous driving in particular is an upcoming field, so users who wish to create autonomous vehicles may find use from our obstacle avoidance system. Unfortunately, our obstacle avoidance system is designed specifically for navigating dry lake beds, so it's general use is limited. 

\section{Operating Environment}
Since the mission is being performed only once in a specific location, the software will be optimized to work best in those conditions. The mission takes place in Black Rock Nevada, in a dry lake bed. This means the navigation software needs to deal with rocks, cracks, and tire tracks, but not much elevation change. Therefore, the navigation software will only work properly in locations similar to Black Rock Nevada. The rest of the software functions could work correctly in other conditions, however. 

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
Space is a precious commodity on this satellite, therefore, the least amount of hardware possible will be fitted to it. This limits resources such as power, computation speed, and memory. This means the software will need to be implemented as simply and efficiently as possible while still being adequate to complete it's task. In addition, the autonomous navigation software must act quickly. If not, the satellite will get stuck, or hit an obstacle before the software can correct course to avoid it.

\section{User Documentation}
There will be a manual included with the satellite in PDF format, which details what each function of the software does, as well as it's limitations. For example, in the Obstacle Avoidance section, the manual will list the types of obstacles the software recognizes and avoids. In addition, the code itself will be well commented, so that future developers can understand what it is doing.

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
Since the satellite is being designed at the same time as the software which runs it, hardware specifics aren't known. We have a general idea of what the rover should be when it's finished, but specifics such as the placement of sensors, or even which sensors will be included, isn't currently known. As the project progresses, more details will be revealed to us, and we should be able to adjust the software accordingly.

\subsection{Description and Priority}
This system will need to detect when the satellite has been deployed from the rocket and activate the parachute module to carry the CanSat safely to the ground.

\section{Change to Drive Mode}

\subsection{Description and Priority}
This system will need to get the rover ready to drive once it has landed on the ground. This could involve activating various servos within the CanSat to expand the rover from the payload container.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\section{Sensor and Motor Array Initialization}

\subsection{Description and Priority}
	The driving sensors and motors made need first time initialization before it can begin driving. This would include locking on to the target GPS coordinates, and preparing any sensors needed for the obstacle avoidance system.


\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}


\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\section{Obstacle Avoidance System}

\subsection{Description and Priority}
	Once the rover is locked on to the target GPS location, it will need to autonomously drive to the target location. This could be anywhere from less than a kilometer to fourteen kilometers depending on how the parachute is carried. There will be obstacles between where the rover lands and the target location such as rocks that will need to be avoided by our rover. This system will take input from the rover's on-board sensors and use that data to control motor function so that the obstacles will be avoided.
