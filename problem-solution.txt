Our primary solution is to create software capable of autonomously navigating our rover to a certain destination. This software will use a combination of GPS coordinates and an obstacle avoidance system. Sensors will be attached to the rover, which our software will take advantage of to "see" the world around it. Our software may have to include algorithms for maneuvering the various sensors to get a better picture of what the terrain looks like. The rover will be navigating across a dry lake bed, so obstacles would consist of cracks in the ground, and tire tracks. Both of these obstacles could possibly get the rover stuck, so avoiding driving through these obstacles and finding an alternate route around them is the most important aspect of the software. A GPS will be used to determine a general direction to travel, but the obstacle avoidance system will determine detour routes around potential obstacles. Additionally, if the obstacle avoidance system fails and the rover does get stuck, the software should attempt to free the rover from whatever is impeding it's progress. Secondly, we would also like to collect data from the rover while it is airborne. To do this, we will write software which takes periodic measurements from attached sensors, such as a temperature sensor, which the rover will transmit in real time. We will collect this data on the ground and display it in real time as a constantly changing graph. At Expo, we will demonstrate our rover's path finding abilities by creating an obstacle course for it to navigate. We will also include a simulation of data we may collect while airborne and show our data visualization tool running in real time.
